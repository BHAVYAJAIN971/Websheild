WebShield: Fake Website Detection System
WebShield is an advanced, data-driven cybersecurity system that leverages machine learning techniques to detect fake websites and phishing attacks. By analyzing various factors such as URLs, HTTPS status, traffic patterns, and metadata, WebShield aims to enhance online security and protect users from malicious websites.

Features:
XGBoost & Random Forest Models: The project implements powerful machine learning models like XGBoost and Random Forest to classify and detect phishing websites with high accuracy. These models were trained using carefully engineered features extracted from URLs and website metadata, enabling real-time detection of suspicious sites.

HTTPS Validation: The system checks whether a website uses HTTPS encryption, a crucial factor in determining website security. Websites with invalid or missing HTTPS certificates are flagged as potentially dangerous.

Traffic Analysis: WebShield analyzes website traffic patterns to detect anomalies or patterns commonly associated with phishing or fraudulent activities, adding an additional layer of detection.

URL Parsing: The project includes advanced URL parsing techniques to identify suspicious components in URLs, such as odd domain names or mismatched protocols, which are often indicative of phishing attempts.

How It Works:
Input: Users provide a URL for analysis.
URL Parsing: The system extracts important features from the URL, such as domain, path, and query parameters, to identify potentially malicious characteristics.
HTTPS Validation: The system checks the validity of the website's HTTPS certificate.
Traffic Analysis: It analyzes traffic patterns to detect unusual behavior.
Prediction: Using trained models (XGBoost and Random Forest), the system predicts whether the website is legitimate or phishing. The output is presented as a "YES" or "NO" indicating whether the URL is safe or suspicious.
Technologies Used:
XGBoost: A powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, known for its efficiency and accuracy.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
Scikit-Learn: A comprehensive machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
HTTPS Validation: Using Python's built-in libraries to validate the security of the website's connection.
URL Parsing: Using regular expressions and URL parsing libraries to extract meaningful features from URLs.
Project Details:
The system is designed to run in real-time, providing instant predictions for any given URL.
Feature engineering plays a significant role in achieving high model accuracy, incorporating both structural and behavioral website data.
The project is easily deployable and can be integrated into existing security systems for enhanced protection against phishing attacks.
