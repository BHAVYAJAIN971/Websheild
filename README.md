The Phishing Website Detection System offers a robust security mechanism to identify and block phishing domains before they reach users. This project introduces a straightforward and portable solution to detect spoofed webpages and address security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning. The system is user-friendly, with all major operations handled in the backend. Users simply input a URL into the GUI and click the submit button to receive results: "YES" for a phishing URL and "NO" for a safe URL.

Python Dependencies:

NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Pickle: For exporting the trained model to the local machine.
Tkinter, PyQt, QtDesigner: For creating the software's graphical user interface (GUI).
To simplify package and library installations, use Anaconda from www.anaconda.com. It is a comprehensive Python platform that includes essential ML libraries, data analysis tools, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, and more, ensuring ease of use and efficiency.
